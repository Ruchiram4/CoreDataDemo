This project server as a demo for anyone who wishes to learn Core Data in Swift.

The purpose of this project is to help someone new to Core Data get up to speed and be able to use the technology by providing them with a working code sample. The project demonstrates how we can use the CoreData API effectively for the most common **CRUD** operations.
